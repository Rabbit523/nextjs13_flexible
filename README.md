# Build and Deploy a Full Stack Next.js 13 Application | React, Next JS 13, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

## Introduction
Next.js has the potential to revolutionize the industry and forever change the way we develop web applications. Youâ€™re still early in catching the trend and building your own Next.js 13 applications with TypeScript that leverage features such as server-side rendering and the app router.

Alongside building this application, you'll also learn how to:
- Use Next.js 13 App Router and Server side Rendering
- Implement Filtering Functionality
- Complete Pagination Capabilities
- Handle image uploads
- Understanding and writing proper TypeScript
- Learn Grafbase - a serverless GraphQL platform

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
